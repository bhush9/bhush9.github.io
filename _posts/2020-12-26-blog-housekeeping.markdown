So today I did some housekeeping on my blog,

- Moving it to new server, old server was based on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus, which is quite old now (I still get security updates, but some packages are quite out-of-date and needs quite some PPAs to manage it)
- Updating it to latest minima theme and removing some of custom templates I had
- Removing disqus plugin, as I realized ultimately I get less and less comments there and it can be invasive to privacy for readers of this blog
- Killing the Google analytics from my blog, this is something which I had added back in 2015 without much of thinking, but in fairness I was not looking at dashboards for this site from quite while now. I will also take care to delete the data from Google Analytics Dashboard

I had planned to write different blog post but this housekeeping took most of the time for me, so I will finish post tomorrow.

On separate topic, I realize my blog has been dormant for a year now. Last blog post I made was [Plasma Mobile as a daily driver](https://blog.bshah.in/2019/12/20/plasma-mobile-as-daily-driver/) about when I was stuck in Europe with no working phones except PinePhone. While this blog was mostly dormant, I had been writing various posts and contributing to posts on [Plasma Mobile blog](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/blog/).

I still have several blog posts which are stuck in the draft state (looking at git status of my blog repo, 7 draft posts at moment), I feel like making writing blog posts habit will help me finish them finally ðŸ™ƒ. Which is why I am signing myself up for [#100DaysToOffload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com/) by Kev Quirk. I know that I will probably end up writing 25-30 posts compared to 100, but as guidelines say, it is fine

> Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year. You don't need to publish a post every 3 days - if you want a week off, that's fine. If it comes to the end of the year and you have only published 60 posts, that's also fine. **Just. Write.**

That will be much better already compared to 0 posts in whole year ðŸ˜œ. I will also update my planet.kde.org RSS feed URL to tag-specific URL so that Planet KDE does not get spammed with off-topic blog posts if I make any on this blog ðŸ™‚.

Day #1 of the #100DaysToOffload series.
