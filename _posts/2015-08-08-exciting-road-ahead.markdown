Hello planet!

I am pleased to say that now I am sponsored by [Blue systems GmBH](http://www.blue-systems.com/) to work on Plasma mobile and Plasma mobile applications full-time for next 4 months.

During this time period I will be mainly working on Plasma Mobile. I will develop the new Applications for Plasma Mobile as well as port existing ones to work in Plasma Mobile.

It is awesome opportunity for me, I will start to work on this 15th August.

So in short,

```
Plasma++;
KDE++;
```
