Hello planet! KDE India team is going to organize a KDE India conference 2014 in DAIICT, Gandhinagar. In KDE India conference there are many awesome talks. In fact every talk is interesting but I find this talks more interesting.

* [Baloo - Metadata and Search](http://kde.in/content/baloo-metadata-and-search) by Vishesh Handa
* [C++11: A Language Renaissance](http://kde.in/content/c11-language-renaissance) by Kévin Ottens
* [KDE unlike a coconut](http://kde.in/content/kde-unlike-coconut) by Smit Shah, Let me find out what's wrong with coconuts? I like them, they are sweet! :(
* [Mer project - powering Jolla Sailfish and Plasma Active](http://kde.in/content/mer-project-powering-jolla-sailfish-and-plasma-active) by Siteshwar Vashisht and Shantanu Tushar.
* [Where KDE is and where it is going](http://kde.in/content/where-kde-and-where-it-going) by Jos Poortvliet

And of course my own talk, [Introduction to Plasma Next by KDE](http://kde.in/content/plasma-workspace-2-introduction)

In this talk I will give introduction to Plasma Next, changes in Plasma Next and if there is enough time I will demostrate installation of KDE Frameworks 5 and Plasma Next.

I am already excited about KDE India conference 2014, because it is the first KDE event that I am going to attend and first talk at any KDE event (Well, no stage fear).
