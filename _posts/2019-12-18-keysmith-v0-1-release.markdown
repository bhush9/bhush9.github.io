I am happy to announce the v0.1 release of the [keysmith](https://invent.kde.org/kde/keysmith).

Keysmith is Two-factor code generator for Plasma Mobile and Desktop.

You can get first release from the

[https://download.kde.org/stable/keysmith/0.1/](https://download.kde.org/stable/keysmith/0.1/)

It has been gpg signed by my personal key with fingerprint

`0AAC 775B B643 7A8D 9AF7  A3AC FE07 8411 7FBC E11D`

Please note that this is a v 0.1 release and there are known issues with Keysmith. In particular the storage of secrets for tokens is not implemented securely yet. **Only use this for testing purposes, do not use this with real account data just yet.** This release is for you if:

- you are excited about an app for KDE for 2 factor authentication and want to get involved
- you are a packager who want to get a head's start so you are well prepared for v1.0 when it finally lands

Again, **please do not use this for real accounts yet**: Keysmith is not secure at this point. But you can help! If you want to help out head over to [https://invent.kde.org/kde/keysmith/issues/](https://invent.kde.org/kde/keysmith/issues/).
