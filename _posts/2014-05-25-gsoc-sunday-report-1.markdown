Hello planet! This is first report for my GSoC project porting plasma mediacenter to Qt5/KF5 and Implementing shell package.

So far I have,

* With help from sebas ported away plugin loading code from deprecated methods and macros
* Ported Plasma mediacenter welcome screen and media browser to QtQuick 2.0 and Plasna Next components.
* Cleaned source code of autotests and ported away from deprecated methods

Now enough words,

Lets checkout some screenshots..

![Mediacenter youtube browsing]({{ site.url }}/images/mediabrowser-youtube.png)
Somehow thumbnails are not working properly for online backends.. This is best screenshot I was able to get.. :D


So that's it for today.. Next week I have my exams so I will skip next report. Thanks for reading..
