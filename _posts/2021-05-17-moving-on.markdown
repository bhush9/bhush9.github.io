I [joined Bluesystems GmbH in August 2015](https://blog.bshah.in/2015/08/08/exciting-road-ahead/), over the course of ~6 years I had opportunity to work in some of most exciting projects (in no particular order).

- KDE Plasma Mobile and Desktop
- Plasma-bigscreen
- Halium
- KDE Neon
- Several other hardware bring-up projects

I also had opportunity to work with some of nicest colleagues and most-skilled hackers,

However, I have decided to leave Bluesystems at end of this month. I am thankful to Bluesystems for sponsoring work on KDE and in general open-source development. If you are interested in working with them, they are looking for new personnel in various areas, [their about page](https://blue-systems.com/about/) gives more information about this.

Next month after short holidays, I will be joining [MBRDI](https://www.mbrdi.co.in/about-us/) as a consulting software engineer for my next adventure.

I hope to continue my volunteer involvement in KDE community and Plasma Mobile as time permits.

Day #7 of the #100DaysToOffload series.
