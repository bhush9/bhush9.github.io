Hello planet! Just a quick note that CFP form for KDE India conference 2014 is going to end in 2 days (3rd December 2013). So if you are interested in giving lightning talks, tutorials, tech demos please fill the [form](http://conf.kde.in/cfp.html) early.

As [Shaan7](http://www.shantanutushar.com) (Shantanu Tushar Jha) says,

* KDE contributors wanting to share knowledge/experience
* People who have participated in GSoC, SoK, OPW or similar, to talk about how their project experience was
* People who have submitted a couple of patches

should give talks at KDE India conference to motivate students attending event.

KDE India conference 2014 is going to run from 21st to 23rd February at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.

So please keep awesome talks coming.
