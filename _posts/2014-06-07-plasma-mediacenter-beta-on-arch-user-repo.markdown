As you already know, Plasma mediacenter 1.3 beta is [released](http://sinny.in/pmc1.3beta) on 3rd June.

Many distros like Fedora, openSUSE, KUbuntu have already packaged this beta in their repositories

So to make life of Archers easier, I have uploaded PKGBUILD for Plasma mediacenter 1.3 beta on AUR.

to install use your AUR helper,

```packer plasma-mediacenter-git```

If you get any bugs please report on [bugs.kde.org](https://bugs.kde.org)

PS: This is first package I am going to maintain on Arch Linux User Repos..
