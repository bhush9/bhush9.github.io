Hello planet! This is Bhushan Shah. I am 18 years old, will be 19 years on this 13th sept. I am from India. I am using Linux and KDE from last two/three years. I started KDE development by porting KGet widget to QML, well not yet merged to master due to some bugs. After that I started to explore some other parts of the KDE like kde-workspace.

Recently I made into SoK, Season Of KDE. My project is to port plasmoids and DataEngines to KDE Framework 5. In this project Sebastian KÃ¼gler (sebas) will mentor me. Initially I have ported some DataEngines to use KDE Framework 5. I will post more updates to this blog and it will get syndicated to Planet KDE.
