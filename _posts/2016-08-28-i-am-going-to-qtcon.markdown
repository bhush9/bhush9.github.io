![Weee akademy]({{ site.url }}/images/Going-To-Akademy-2016.png)

[QtCon](http://qtcon.org) starts on this Sept 1st and I will be traveling to Berlin on this Tuesday. This is second Akademy I am attending after Akademy 2014 in Czech Republic. During QtCon I am giving presentation titled [Plasma Mobile: what we achieved in year](https://conf.qtcon.org/en/qtcon/public/events/330) in room A04 on 2nd September. And also I am going to moderate a [Student Presentations](https://conf.qtcon.org/en/qtcon/public/events/399) where students taking part in various mentoring programs in KDE, like GSoC, GCI, SoK, or OPW.

Also I am taking part in various BoFs starting from Sept 5, like Plasma BoF, KDE SoC, and KDE Neon BoF.

Looking forward to productive QtCon! See you in Berlin! :-)
