.image-70[![Cake is lie](cake.jpg)]
# ... or is it?

---

# Needs improvement

- Quality

- Testing

- Applications

- Manpower

???

- we need people to start testing, developing on plasma mobile
- we need more applications for daily usage on plasma mobile
- we need to imrpove the quality of plasma mobile shell

---

# External factors affecting Plasma Mobile project

- Kernel versions are too old

- Lack of the open devices

- Devices requires closed source BSP to function to full extent.

???

- devices are getting hard and hard to "tinker"
    - locked bootloader
    - forced encryption
- you are stuck with older kernel version provided by vendor
    - security issues
- modem firmware is the operating system in itself

# postmarketOS

- Project started by Oliver Smith

- Aims for 10 year life-cycle of the phones

- Alpine Linux as the minimal base

- Currently using weston as a reference UI

- Wants to use Plasma Mobile

- Bart Ribbers (PureTryOut) packaged Plasma Mobile on postmarketOS

???

- doesn't use any of the binary blobs provided by android
- Native linux, no android container
- Devices with no open accelerated graphics stack, it uses the framebuffer backend

---

# Open devices

- Open Devices program by Sony

- Effort to support devices by mainline kernel

- Fairphone

- Purism's Linux phone(?)

---

# Conclusion

- Journey towards open mobile platform is hard

- We are not the only ones on same path

- We as a community should work on it together
